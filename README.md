# HuffmanEncoder
This program reads input from a file and loads the letters as keys and their frequencies as values, then prints the results to the terminal for the user to view.

First, we create a Hashtable to store the key-value pairs. Then, we use the specified file path (which can be changed) to read input character by character while accounting for special characters. These values are dynamically loaded into the Hashtable initialized earlier.

`note`: In the example output it had the keys ordered alphabetically but in java they are random unless you use treemap. however all the keys and values are correct.
